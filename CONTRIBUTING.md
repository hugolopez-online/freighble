## Commit and Issue Guidelines

To maintain a clean and consistent history, we follow a strict format for **commit messages** and **issue titles**. Please read carefully and refer to the examples provided below.

---

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

#### üîπ Examples (Correct)

```
feat(auth): add signup form validation
fix(api): prevent crash on empty payload
chore(ci): update GitHub workflow for linting
refactor(styles): simplify theme switcher logic
```

#### üî∏ Examples (Incorrect)

```
fixed bug in login page
added feature
update code
chore: fix
```

---

### Issue Title Format

Each issue title should reflect the type and scope, written in this format:

```
[TYPE][SCOPE] Short description of the problem or request
```

#### üîπ Examples (Correct)

-   `[BUG][FORM] Whitespace in first name field causes error`
-   `[FEAT][AUTH] Allow login with GitHub OAuth`
-   `[CHORE][CONFIG] Update ESLint rules for consistency`

#### üî∏ Examples (Incorrect)

-   `bug in form`
-   `add github login`

### Tips

-   Keep descriptions short but meaningful.
-   Use the **imperative mood** (‚Äúadd‚Äù, not ‚Äúadded‚Äù or ‚Äúadds‚Äù).
-   Your commit and issue formats help automate changelogs, releases, and improve readability.

Thank you for keeping the project tidy and consistent.
