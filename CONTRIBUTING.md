# Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!  
To ensure clarity and consistency across contributions, we follow a standardized format for:

-   Commit messages
-   Issue titles
-   Branch names

All of these share the same **types** and **scopes**. Below you'll find the complete guide.

> üìù In the format templates below:
>
> -   **Curly braces `{...}`** indicate optional parts ‚Äî do **not** include the braces.
> -   **Angle brackets `<...>`** represent placeholders ‚Äî also to be replaced, **not** typed literally.

## Format Overview
